## Elastic IP

- Private IPs are accessible only inside the private network
---
- **Elastic IP** is used, when you need a fixed IP for your instance as Publc IPs keep changing when you _reboot_ or stop an instance
- _Elastic IP_ is billed when it is not associated with an instance
- The address remains the same even after _restarting_ the instance, does not change like public Ipv4
- You can attach it to only one instance at a time
